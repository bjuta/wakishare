# Implementation Tasks

- [x] Enable visitors to toggle reactions on and off without throttling so they can change their support at any time.
- [x] Persist multiple concurrent reactions per visitor on the front end and in REST responses.
- [x] Bundle the full emoji dictionary used by the reaction picker so administrators can curate the available set.
- [x] Expose admin controls for toggling individual emojis and syncing those settings to the front-end reaction bars.
- [x] Update the share interface so that the first five networks render immediately and the remaining options sit behind a share icon toggle.
- [x] Adjust the share totals layout to use a stacked "Shares" label above the numeric counter.
